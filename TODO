drg vol1 They're Here.mp3 has encoding problem in name metadata, but only in my music player

rest of wf ost

also check to see if some of local could be in dl

add doc comment lines at start of files?

note:
youtube abcdABCD123  ->  https://youtu.be/abcdABCD123
soundcloud 895013827  ->  https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/895013827

some way to just adapt the arch-dl checks to arch-arch

keep state in folders - don't update m3u if unnecessary, log important variables (eg playlist vs album)
m3u mtime vs last list change?
untouched check in dl?

match identical songs with added artists eg purity filter

move logs to persistant location?

skip previously known-to-be-available and -unavailable entries in file playlist?

add error for $0 = /bin/sh etc (no match to *.sh)

seperate init.sh functions beyond xargs rm or toarchive into source files when $1 = something?
